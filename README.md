# Quartz - A DEVS-based Modeling & Simulation Environment (WIP)

Quartz is a Crystal library for defining models and constructing discrete
event simulations based on the DEVS (Discrete EVent System Specification) and
some of its extensions (Parallel DEVS, DSDEVS). Its a Crystal port of
[DEVS-Ruby](https://github.com/devs-ruby)

This project is developed by a research group at University of Corsica, which
also maintains another M&S environment :
[DEVSimPy](https://github.com/capocchi/DEVSimPy).

## Status

This project is a **work in progress** and is in alpha stage.
