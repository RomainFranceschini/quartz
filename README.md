# Quartz - A DEVS-based Modeling & Simulation Environment (WIP)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/romain1189/quartz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/romain1189/quartz)

Quartz is a Crystal library for defining models and constructing discrete
event simulations based on the PDEVS (Parallel Discrete EVent System Specification) and
some of its extensions (DSDE, multiPDEVS). Its a Crystal port of
[DEVS-Ruby](https://github.com/devs-ruby)

This project is developed by a research group at University of Corsica, which
also maintains another M&S environment :
[DEVSimPy](https://github.com/capocchi/DEVSimPy).

## Status

This project is a **work in progress** and is in alpha stage.

## Installation

### Requirements 

* Crystal. Please refer to <http://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation> for
  instructions for your operating system.

### Setup

Crystal applications and libraries are expected to have a `shard.yml` file
at their root. Create a `shard.yml` file in your project's folder (or add to it) with the following contents:

```yaml
dependencies:
  quartz:
    github: romain1189/quartz
    version: 0.1.0
```

Replace the version *0.1.0* with the actual version of Quartz you wish to use.

Then, resolve dependencies with shards (Crystal dependency manager) to install Quartz and its requirements as a dependency of your project:

```
$ crystal deps
```

### Usage

```crystal
require "quartz"

class LotkaVolterra < Quartz::AtomicModel
  state_var x : Float64 = 1.0
  state_var y : Float64 = 1.0
  state_var alpha : Float64 = 5.2     # prey reproduction rate
  state_var beta : Float64 = 3.4      # predator per prey mortality rate
  state_var gamma : Float64 = 2.1     # predator mortality rate
  state_var delta : Float64 = 1.4     # predator per prey reproduction rate

  @sigma = 0.0001                     # euler integration

  def internal_transition
    dxdt = ((@x * @alpha) - (@beta * @x * @y))
    dydt = (-(@gamma * @y) + (@delta * @x * @y))

    @x += @sigma * dxdt
    @y += @sigma * dydt
  end
end

model = LotkaVolterra.new(:lotka)
sim = Quartz::Simulation.new(model, duration: 20)
sim.simulate
```

```
$ crystal build lotka.cr
$ ./lotka
```

## Differences with [DEVS-Ruby](https://github.com/devs-ruby)

Classic DEVS is not supported.
